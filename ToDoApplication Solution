TO -DO APPlICATION

Creating a to-do app involves multiple steps, including designing the user interface, developing the application, and implementing the features. Here's a simplified guide on how you might approach creating a basic to-do app:

1. Planning:
Define the features and functionalities in our to-do app as instructed by Product Owner.
Sketch a rough layout of the user interface.

2. Choose a Technology Stack:
Decide on the technologies we will  use for front-end (HTML, CSS) and back-end (Node.js) development.
Select a database (MySQL) to store tasks.

3. Development:
a. Front-End Development:
Create the UI using HTML .
(Implement features like adding tasks, deleting tasks, editing tasks as completed.)
b. Back-End Development:
Set up a server using   MySQL back-end technology.
Create APIs/endpoints for handling tasks (CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Implementing  user authentication is required.
c. Database:
Set up and configure the chosen database.
Create tables or collections to store task-related information.

4. Integration:
Connect the front-end and back-end parts of our application.
Ensure proper communication between the client and server using APIs.

5. Testing:
Perform unit tests to check individual components.
Conduct integration tests to ensure different parts of the app work together.

6. Deployment:
Deploy your app to a hosting service such as  AWS  for users to access.

7. Continual Improvement:
Gather user feedback and make improvements based on usability and feature requests.
